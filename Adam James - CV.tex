\section{Notable Experience \& Achievements}
%\begin{textblock}{1}(12.5,3.12)\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{oracle}\end{textblock}
\cventry{Feb. 2013 - Present}{Oracle Corporation}{}{Melton}{}{Working on \textit{FRS-POS}, a specialised point of sale, stock logistics and reporting platform written for the furniture retail industry and used by household names worldwide, including a 1000-user deployment in the United States. Our six-person team (responsible for all development and support) joined Oracle with their acquisition of \textit{MICROS Systems} in September of 2014.
\newline{}
\newline{} - Delivered major new feature sets and enhancements instrumental in migrating customers using a UNIX-based version to the current, .NET-based implementation of our team's product. Work spanned all product layers, including user interface, presentation logic, business logic and back-end.
\newline{} - Shipped code across six versions of the product so far, over two years and counting. Created reporting output for new features using Crystal Reports. Back-ported features and fixes to older versions. Used VB.NET, ASP.NET and SQL Server (ensuring code was backwards-compatible.) 
\newline{} - Scheduled maintenance windows with customers and handled new installations, version migrations, software patches and licence renewals, including customer follow-up.
\newline{} - Dealt with third-line support issues in coordination with customers and third parties. Analysed and resolved time-sensitive problems with software, data and OS configuration on live systems.
\newline{} - Designed and built tools to manage licence data, simplifying issuance and shortening maintenance windows. Used C\#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Twitter Bootstrap and JQuery.
\newline{} - Using virtual machines, duplicated customer infrastructure to test .NET SMTP failure modes.
\newline{} - Wrote documentation to spread knowledge, decrease \textit{bus factor} and discourage \textit{learning by osmosis}.
\newline{} - Provided assistance to others with new hardware, during office integration with Oracle.
\newline{}

\cventry{Aug. - Dec. 2012}{Opus Information Technology}{}{Driffield}{}{Worked on \textit{Ensemble}, designed to help housing associations manage the complexities of service charges for social housing. Tasks included translating new requirements into working, extensible software, transforming customer data to meet requirements, fixing reported issues and preparing deployment packages for customers. I also provisioned new internal testing systems.
\newline{}
}

\cventry{July 2012}{LeedsHack 2012 Award Winner}{}{Leeds}{}{As an attendee at LeedsHack (the largest independent hackday outside of London), I volunteered to mentor two under-18's new to software development. Over the next 24 hours - working through the night - they successfully built a functional prototype website allowing users to register for event alerts via SMS from \textit{Breeze} - a local organisation running events for children and young adults. Our team of four won 3 awards including \textit{The HyperLocal Award}, \textit{The Breeze Award} and \textit{Best of Show}.

\cventry{July - Aug. 2011}{ResQ Contact Services}{}{Hull}{}{Worked as part of the NPower Residential Sales team. Sold energy packages directly to UK households in a fast-paced, target driven environment. Gained a solid foundation of sales and marketing skills.
\newline{}
}

\cventry{April - May 2011}{Omerta Game Limited}{}{Hull}{}{Worked on \textit{Omerta}, a web-based MMORPG. Implemented Google Analytics across all versions of the game to prioritise mobile development efforts. Provided help and support to players and moderators.

\cventry{Sept. 2007 - July 2012}{Bachelor of Science (Hons.) in Computer Science}{The University of Hull}{}{\textit{2:2}}
{I learned the value of a strong work ethic, punctuality and teamwork. My approach to work and problem solving improved with individual assignments and learning. I functioned effectively as part of a team in group assignments, working to coordinate, delegate and manage tasks. Took time in 2011 to gain experience in the workforce. Returned in February 2012 and graduated with honours.\\\\
