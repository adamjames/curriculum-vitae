This was a full-stack development role focused on bespoke products and tools for the UK and European markets.
	\newline{} - Developed applications in use by our engineers to commission tracking units using mobile devices. For the first time, our engineers could work  independently to complete field installations and servicing. Automated data-gathering and task closure saves engineers' time and ensures compliance, accuracy and accountability.
	\newline{} - Maintained our customer-facing SOAP/JSON API, making additions and changes in coordination with third parties. Improved error handling and added performance measurement mechanisms. Improved test coverage using SpecFlow.
	\newline{} - Built tools allowing rapid, accurate bulk import of customer information, eliminating the need for manual data transformation and copying by customer service staff and shortening the time taken to onboard customers.
	\newline{} - Configured and utilised CI/CD infrastructure (Jenkins, Octopus Deploy) via Github to allow for one-click compilation, testing, packaging and deployment of new software.
