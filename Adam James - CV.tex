I've experimented with visualising this data on Cosmic Unicorn LED boards using MicroPython. I also used Python, Leaflet and the Bus Open Data Service API's to put \href{https://busmap.tail5c8e3.ts.net/}{every bus in the country on a map}, just because I thought it was interesting. I've also added smooth turn-by-turn routing, taking advantage of OpenStreetMap's routing engine.}}

	\small{\cvitem{LeedsHack}{In 2012, as an attendee at LeedsHack (the largest independent hackday outside of London), I volunteered to mentor two under-18's new to software development. Over the next 24 hours - working through the night - they successfully built a functional prototype website allowing users to register for event alerts via SMS from \textit{Breeze} - a local organisation running events for children and young adults. Our team of four won 3 awards including \textit{The HyperLocal Award}, \textit{The Breeze Award} and \textit{Best of Show}.}}
