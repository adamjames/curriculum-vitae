		\newline{} - Designed and built a Shopify application providing true one-click order fulfilment. Real-time integration processes webhook notifications, forwards orders and notifies Shopify when orders are despatched.
		Dashboard allows detailed management, approval and review of orders. Written using Angular 10, .Net Core, Hangfire, EF Core, ShopifySharp.
		\newline{} - Designed and built a mailshot system for album release announcements. Featured client-side preview and bespoke Node.js Azure functions PDF generation with upload to Blob Storage. Angular 10, .Net Core back-end.
		\newline{} - Implemented PDF microservice and high-throughput data feed pipeline for a sports industry client.
		\newline{} - Built major portions of a custom B2B e-commerce solution using .Net Core, EF Core, SQL Server. Real-time pricing of millions of products on a per-customer basis, with payment via line-of-credit API or SAGEPay.}
	
	\cventry{Nov 2015 -$\triangleright$ Dec 2019}{Ctrack (Inseego Corp.)}{}{Leeds}{}{
		Worked as a Developer for Ctrack; one of the world’s largest telematics (vehicle tracking) companies, with 1,000,000 units deployed in over 50 countries across 5 continents. We provided customers with the means to make targeted improvements to driver behaviour, improving safety and reducing costs. This was a full-stack development role focused on bespoke products and tools for the UK and European markets.
		\newline{} - Developed applications used by engineers to commission tracking units using mobile devices. For the first time, engineers could work independently to complete field installations and servicing. Automated data-gathering and task closure saves engineers' time and ensures compliance, accuracy and accountability.
		\newline{} - Maintained our customer-facing SOAP/JSON API, making additions and changes in coordination with third parties. Improved error handling and added performance measurement mechanisms. Improved test coverage using SpecFlow.
		\newline{} - Built tools allowing rapid, accurate bulk import of customer information, eliminating the need for manual data transformation and copying by customer service staff and shortening the time taken to onboard customers.
		\newline{} - Configured and utilised CI/CD infrastructure (Jenkins, Octopus Deploy) via Github to allow for one-click compilation, testing, packaging and deployment of new software.}

		Worked on \textit{FRS-POS}, a specialised point of sale, stock logistics and reporting platform written for the furniture retail industry and used by household names worldwide, including a 1000-user deployment in the United States. Our six-person team (responsible for all development and support) joined Oracle with their acquisition of \textit{MICROS Systems} in September of 2014.
		\newline{} - Delivered major new feature sets and enhancements instrumental in migrating customers using a UNIX-based version to the current, .NET-based implementation of our team's product. Work spanned all product layers, including user interface, presentation logic, business logic and back-end.
		\newline{} - Shipped code across six major releases. Created reporting output using Crystal Reports. Back-ported features and fixes to older versions.
		\newline{} - Resolved time-sensitive problems with software, data and OS configuration on live systems. Scheduled and handled third-line maintenance including new installations, version migrations, software patches, licence renewals, including customer follow-up. 
		\newline{} - Built tools to manage licence data, simplifying issuance and shortening maintenance windows. Duplicated customer infrastructure for root cause analysis using virtual machines.
		\newline{} - Assisted with migration to new development machines and workflows. Wrote documentation to spread knowledge, decrease \textit{bus factor} and discourage \textit{learning by osmosis}.

	\cventry{July 2012}{LeedsHack 2012 Award Winner}{}{Leeds}{}{As an attendee at LeedsHack (the largest independent hackday outside of London), I volunteered to mentor two under-18's new to software development. Over the next 24 hours - working through the night - they successfully built a functional prototype website allowing users to register for event alerts via SMS from \textit{Breeze} - a local organisation running events for children and young adults. Our team of four won 3 awards including \textit{The HyperLocal Award}, \textit{The Breeze Award} and \textit{Best of Show}.}
	\small{\cvitem{Tinkering}{At home, I've built up a small collection of projects and services - some of them are even useful.

	{I learned the value of a strong work ethic, punctuality and teamwork. My approach to work and problem solving improved with individual assignments and learning. I functioned effectively as part of a team in group assignments, working to coordinate, delegate and manage tasks. Took time in 2011 to gain experience in the workforce. Returned in February 2012 and graduated with honours.\\\\
